        <!-- Installation
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_installation">
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p class="lead">Follow the steps below to download and use avatar addon in minecraft:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Download the pack from any link. Because you're actually reading the documentation, here is a no-ads link: <a href="https://modbay.net/mods/312-avatar-addon.html" target="_blank">Free Download</a></li></li>
            <li>Next, open it with in minecraft. If you're on PC, double click it. If you're on apple, use a different file editor to open it in minecraft (google drive works too). Android users can use "File Manger +" for importing into minecraft (If importing issues still persist then import manually).</li>
            <li>Make sure the download goes through as normal (check the bug fixing tab if not), and then apply both the resource and behaviour packs to your world as normal.</li>
            <li>You are good to go! Check the setup tab if you can't figure out how to get started.</li>
          </ol>

        <!-- HTML Structure
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_html_structure">
          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>When you start out, nothing will happen. First, you will have the bending scroll in your hotbar upon entry on the world. After that, you can choose your bending by opening it (long press or right click).<br>
          <center><img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/avatar-addon-bending-scroll.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100"></center>
	  <p>The options are avatar, fire, earth, water, air, and human (normal vanilla Minecraft, with the ability to learn chi-blocking).<br>
	  <center><img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/choose_bending_menu.png" alt="" width="350" height="350"></center>
	  <p>When you pick a bending style, nothing will happen - you need to choose your moves for each of your “slots”. For instance, if you sneak then punch you will use whatever move is bound to slot 4. Let’s say you are an Airbender, and used the scroll to set slot 4 to Air Blast - when you sneak and punch, you will use Air Blast. You can use your scroll to bind moves to slots. Just right click/long press on your scroll, and click on the sub-menu button “Choose Slots”. Try picking slot 4 first (remember to click on submit after all slots choice has been filled), since it’s the simplest. Eventually, you’ll have your slots memorized, and a set of 4 moves you like best. These 4 that you have “slot loaded” is what makes you different from other benders of the same type.<br>
	  <p>Each type of bender will have a different moveset, and each individual bender will have an even more varied set of moves. As you level up, you get access to more moves. To level up, simply go about as normal - using moves will help you level up, but don’t try to afk, it won’t work.<br>
	  <p>Sometimes, bending can get annoying while just going about your normal tasks, so you can turn it off for a bit by holding arrows in your off-hand, or by typing right cliking/long pressing the scroll and then click/tap settings and click/tap the button that says "Enable Bending".<br>
	  <p>The moves and abilities of these classes are outlined below, and also through the bending scroll with the "Bending Info" section.<br>
	  <p>Have fun playing!<br>

		<!-- Sass
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_sass">
          <h2>Admin Menu</h2>
          <p>How to get the settings menu as an operator. First, check that you are op on the current world. If you don't know how, press escape or pause and see if your name has the crown next to it. Then, check your scroll menu, and click through: Admin Menu, it should look like this:</p>
	  <img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/settings_menu.png" alt=""></li>
	  <p>There are a few options, and each will be described below:</p>
          <p></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Player Level:<br /></strong>This option lets you edit any player's bending level. As you may already know, your level dictates what kind of moves you have access to and how strong each move is. The ability to edit it can be used to unlock all moves for testing purposes or to punish other players. Remember to click/tap submit afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Player Inventory:<br /></strong>This option powerful tool that allows an administrator or operator to view the contents of a player's inventory. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as helping to resolve disputes over lost items, checking for cheats or exploits, or simply for curiosity.</li>
<li><strong>World Settings:<br /></strong>This settings controls a bunch of stuff. Firstly, the chat rank system. Chat ranks are enabled by default,and show an icon of your bending style next to your name when you send a chat message. You can enable and disable this feature with no consequence. Next up, the avatar setting. If it is enabled, players can freely select avatar - most likely you will have more than one avatar. But, if it's disabled, players can only choose one of the four nations bending styles to choose from. After that comes the shop system toggle - a&nbsp;setting that controlls whether players can buy, sell, and use money with the scroll shop menu. If enabled, players can wirelessly buy, sell, and store money in a scoreboard. If it is disabled, these options will not be available. Next, the sethome system - a setting that controlls whether players can set homes (6 is the upper limit) that they can teleport back to in seconds with the scroll (don't worry, they can't do it in combat). Finally, and most unstable - cooldown time, a setting that controlls whether players have a cooldown when using moves. If you want a smooth non-buggy experience DO NOT use this setting.&nbsp; It doubles the lag instantly, plus a plethora of other issues. As always, remember to click/tap submit afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Ping:</strong><br />When this option is clicked, the server will respond with the current tps (ticks per second) and the player's ping in milliseconds. The tps is a measure of the server's performance, with a higher tps indicating a smoother and more efficient server. A tps of 20 is generally considered to be the target for a well-running server, although some servers may be able to handle higher or lower tps depending on their hardware and configuration.</li>
</ol>

		  <h3 id="v1-1">Version 1.19 <small class="text-muted">(12 Oct, 2020)</small></h3>
          <ul class="changelog">
            <li><span class="badge badge-success">Added</span> Sub-bending: This new update adds sub-bending, which is unlocked at level 15, and can differ for each type. For Airbenders: Spirit - lets you become a spirit (unlockable new move at level 50), which can fly through blocks and scout areas out. Projectile -  bends the air around your arrows so they never miss again (range increases with level). For Firebenders: Lightning - certain moves get a buff of added lightning and you unlock a few new moves. Combustion - get an extra move similar to fire blast, but a beam with more range. You must be on full health to use. For Waterbenders: Blood - lets you freeze players in place on full moons. Healing -  heal yourself and other players. Buffs any healing moves greatly, and adds team moves. For Earthbenders: Metal - get extra iron when mining and a few new moves that consume iron ingots. Lava - get new moves that have a separate cooldown!</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-success">Added</span> Shop: This new update adds a command known as !shop, which you can use to buy and sell items using just the chat. It has a bunch of subcommands, here they all are: !shop sell <price></price> - Sells whatever item you have in your main hand, for whatever price you specify from 10 to 10,000. !shop list - List all the items in the shop currently, each with their selection value so you can buy them. !shop buy <selection value=""></selection> - Buys the item with that selection value, automatically using your money to pay. !shop pay <player> <amount> </amount></player>- Pay another player money. !shop balance -Show your current balance. !shop help - show a help menu.</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-success">Added</span> Optimizations: The entire addon has been optimized, so future updates will come faster, and include more moves. As well, most moves will revert back to their original state, as to not damage the environment.</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-info">Updated</span> Movelist: The previous movelist command has been replaced with a new command: !info The new syntax is: !info <moves passives="" slots="">. </moves>When using the command, it would look like !info slots. The system is much better for chat spam now, and automatically updates if you decide to add custom moves!</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-info">Updated</span> Home: The !home command syntax has now been condensed into a single command, for instance: !home set Name. The new syntax is: !home set <name></name> - Creates a new home you can tp back to, at the position where you are standing.  !home teleport <name></name> - Teleports you back to one of your 6 homes! !home delete <name></name> - Delete one of your homes! !home list - list your homes.</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-info">Updated</span> Stats: The old command !stats has been changed to accept an argument now, like !stats @GlitchyTurtle32.</li>
            <li><span class="badge badge-danger">Fixed</span> Chi-blocking now resets your combo so you can't preload it per one hit.</li>
	    <li><span class="badge badge-danger">Fixed</span> Redundant scoreboards removed.</li>
